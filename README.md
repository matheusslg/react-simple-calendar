# React Simple Calendar

This project was created using React and it's a simple calendar, displaying dates through the months and also allows user to create reminders. This project also used EmotionJS (CSS-in-JS), React Testing Library (JEST) and Redux (as a state controller).

## Available Scripts

Here we have some scripts available to run:

### `yarn start`

### `yarn test`

### `yarn build`

## How it works

It's quite simple, if you are in a desktop, just double click inside a day and it'll generate a new event for you automatically:
